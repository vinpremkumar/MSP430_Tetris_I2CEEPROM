# MSP430_Tetris_I2CEEPROM
Similar to my other project https://github.com/vinpremkumar/MSP_Tetris_song; But here, we will utilize I2C interface to an EEPROM to store the song's frequency data into an EEPROM instead. MSP430 will read from EEPROM and sing the song through a speaker

I suggest going through the references to learn how I2C interface works
